# English-Word-Finder
A python script to find Possible ENGLISH word from given letters

**Title:** Python Word Finder

**Description:**

This Python script provides a tool to discover all valid English words that can be formed from a set of input letters. It utilizes efficient algorithms and a comprehensive word list to deliver accurate results.

**Features:**

- Finds all possible combinations of words from the provided letters.
- Optionally filters results based on a desired word size.
- Leverages the `itertools.permutations` function for efficient generation of letter arrangements.
- Employs a set-based approach for faster word lookup.

**Instructions:**

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**
   Obtain the code from this repository using Git or by downloading the ZIP archive.

2. **Install Dependencies (Optional):**
   - The code doesn't require any external libraries beyond those included in the standard Python distribution.

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script (`word_finder.py`).
   - Execute the script using Python: `python word_finder.py`

4. **User Interaction:**
   - The script will prompt you to enter the letters you want to explore, separated without spaces.
   - Optionally, you can specify a desired word size (press Enter to skip).
   - The program will then display all possible English words formed from the given letters that meet the size criteria (if provided).

**Example Usage:**

```
Enter the letters to combine (without spaces): hello
Possible English words from the provided letters are: eh, hello, hole, olle

Enter the letters to combine (without spaces): mistake
Enter the word size (optional, press enter to skip): 6
Possible English words from the provided letters are: mistake
```

**Word List:**

The script assumes the presence of a text file named `words.txt` within the same directory. This file should contain a list of valid English words, one per line. You can create or use an existing word list resource.

**Further Enhancements (Optional):**

- Consider incorporating error handling to gracefully manage invalid user input (e.g., non-alphabetic characters).
- Explore advanced filtering options, such as allowing wildcards or regular expressions.
- Provide the ability to specify a custom word list file path.
